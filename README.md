# The course project for CS-E4350: Security Engineering
The aim of this project was to create a full-stack web app that serves messages and stores them securely in encrypted form.

The react front end code is contained in the folder `react-front`. The node back end code is in the folder `node-back`.

In development, the back end and the front end are run separately. In a production environment, the back end hosts the built front end as static assets.
