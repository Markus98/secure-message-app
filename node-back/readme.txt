Currently nothing is crypted, just tested how sql.db works.
Can post and request either all messages or only url. 
Delete should be easy to do. I used Postman for posting, REST can also be used.
SQL consists of one table: 
messages, with "url" as primary key and unique and string, and "crymessage" as string.
